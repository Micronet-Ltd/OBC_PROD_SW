1: J1708 Retry Failures - If the J1708 test is run and then the test is stopped and restarted without rebooting the device then J1708 will fail.
2: Audio Test Failures - Sometimes the audio test will fail because both speakers get shut off instead of just one.
3: Adding APN is hardcoded - APN is currently hardcoded
